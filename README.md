## Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets: An Overview

Over-the-counter (OTC) markets are financial marketplaces where stocks,
bonds, derivatives, currencies, and other instruments are traded
directly between two parties, without the supervision of a formal
exchange. OTC markets allow for the trading of securities that do not
meet the stringent requirements for listing on major exchanges,
providing opportunities for investors to access smaller companies and
emerging markets.
